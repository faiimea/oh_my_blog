# 2-5 Iterator Generator

## Iterator
Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and strings are all iterable objects.

We can iterate over iterable objects(most `for` loop)

While Iterator is not Iteratable objects. An iterator is an object that provides sequential access to values, one by one.
```py
toppings = ["pineapple", "pepper", "mushroom", "roasted red pepper"]

topperator = iter(toppings)
next(iter) # 'pineapple'
next(iter) # 'pepper'
next(iter) # 'mushroom'
next(iter) # 'roasted red pepper'
next(iter) # ❌ StopIteration exception
```

`iter(iterable)` returns an iterator over the elements of an iterable.

`next(iterator)` returns the next element in an iterator.

Use try/except to handle an exception:
```py
try:
    print(next(chocolaterator))
except StopIteration:
    print("No more left!")
```

So when we need handle with iterator of any length, take the loop into exception:

```py
ranked_chocolates = ("Dark", "Milk", "White")
chocolaterator = iter(ranked_chocolates)

try:
    while True:
        choco = next(chocolaterator)
        print(choco)
except StopIteration:
    print("No more left!")
```

(actually, `for` loop is just syntactic sugar)

*Iterator has method like `__iter__()`, and that has the method of `__next__()`

### for
```py
for <name> in <expression>:
    <suite>

==

iterator = iter(<expression>)
try:
    while True:
        <name> = next(iterator)
        <suite>
except StopIteration:
    pass
```

TBH, for loop is always faster than iterator

### function that return iterators
Function	Description
`reversed(sequence)`	Iterate over item in sequence in reverse order 

!! What reverse do is to locate specific position of the last element **now**, so when you append some element after create reverse iter, it won't change, but if you change the element before it, the iter will change as well.

`zip(*iterables)`	Iterate over co-indexed tuples with elements from each of the iterables

zip two or **more** lists together and give list of tuple.(if they have different len, depends on the least one.)




`map(func, iterable, ...)`	Iterate over func(x) for x in iterable 
Same as [func(x) for x in iterable] 

`filter(func, iterable)`	Iterate over x in iterable if func(x) 
Same as [x for x in iterable if func(x)] 

*Calling iter() on an iterator just returns the iterator:
so we can use structure like this
```py
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

for num in filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums):
    print(num)
```

## Generator
A generator is a type of iterator that yields results from a generator function.

A generator function uses yield instead of return:

```py
def evens():
    num = 0
    while num < 10:
        yield num
        num += 2

evengen = evens()

next(evengen)  # 0
next(evengen)  # 2
next(evengen)  # 4
next(evengen)  # 6
next(evengen)  # 8
next(evengen)  # ❌ StopIteration exception
```
When you call the yield function, it will find nwxt yield until there's no yield(有点类似局部状态). If there is no more field, it will cause error StopIteration, The iteration will stop encountering `return` as well.

Q:Why the num keep its status instead of being assigned again to 0?

A: The function just stopped at process, and it will be restart.

We can use for loops on generators, since generators are just special types of iterators.

```py
def evens(start, end):
    num = start + (start % 2)
    while num < end:
        yield num
        num += 2

for num in evens(12, 60):
   print(num)
```

Q:Why we use generator?

A:Generators are lazy: they only generate the next item when needed.

We can use generator to deal with big data. cause generator don't occupy big memory(list will store all things)

* a syntactic sugar: `yield from`
  A yield from statement yields the values from an iterator one at a time
  ```py
  def a_then_b(a, b):
    for item in a:
        yield item
    for item in b:
        yield item

  list(a_then_b(["Apples", "Aardvarks"], ["Bananas", "BEARS"]))

  def a_then_b(a, b):
    yield from a
    yield from b

  list(a_then_b(["Apples", "Aardvarks"], ["Bananas", "BEARS"]))
  ```

所以在python中实现树的前序遍历是比较简单的：
通过yield来实现
```py
def leaves(t):
    yield label(t)
    for c in branches(t):
        yield from leaves(c)
        #这里的yield from其实就起到了递归的作用，在每个循环处递归一次

t = tree(20, [tree(12,
               [tree(9,
                  [tree(7), tree(2)]),
                tree(3)]),
              tree(8,
               [tree(4), tree(4)])])

leave_gen = leaves(t)
next(leave_gen)
```
