# 2-2
  
* multiple variables
`x,y=(1,2)`-> very handy feature

`for x,y in L`(`L=[(1,2)]`)

* `zip()`-> combine multiple sequences, making tuple
  ```py
    >>> list(zip([1, 2, 5, 3], [9, 2, 6, 3, 10]))
    [(1, 9), (2, 2), (5, 6), (3, 3)]
    >>> # Length of result is that of shortest sequence
    >>> list(zip([1, 4, 7, 10], [2, 5, 8, 11], [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]))
    [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9), (10, 11, 12)]
    >>> beasts = ["aardvark", "axolotl", "gnu", "hartebeest"]
    >>> for n, animal in zip(range(1, 5), beasts):
    ...     print(n, animal)
    1 aardvark
    2 axolotl
    3 gnu
    4 hartebeest
    ```

The zip will return 'generators' instead of 'list'

## list

### slice operation
    ```py
    >>> L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    >>> L[2] = 6
    >>> L
    [1, 2, 6, 4, 5]
    >>> L[1:3] = [9, 8]
    >>> L
    [1, 9, 8, 4, 5]
    >>> L[2:4] = []            # Deleting elements
    >>> L
    [1, 9, 5]
    >>> L[1:1] = [2, 3, 4, 5]  # Inserting elements
    >>> L
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 5]
    >>> L[len(L):] = [10, 11]  # Appending
    >>> L
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 5, 10, 11]
    >>> L[0:0] = range(-3, 0)  # Prepending
    # [0:0]代表什么都不包括，不改变任何元素，只从零开始多了一块
    >>> L
    [-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 5, 10, 11]
    ```

### mul of sequence:
```py
[0]*3=[0,0,0]
(1,2)*3=(1,2,1,2,1,2)
"a"*3="aaa"
```
### list comprehension
handy feature as well
`[list(range(1, i + 1)) for i in range(1, n+1)]`
When we use more 'for' loop, it looks like nested loops(嵌套循环)

`[(a,b) for a in range(10,13) for b in range (a,14)]`

With this, we could implement `matches` function with one line, like a cool engineer:
`return sum([1 for x,y in zip(a,b) if x == y])`

The `triangle` function can be done as well.
`return [list(range (1, i+1)) for i in range(1,n+1)]`

Not element, but sequence can be filled in.

### Layers of abstration

layers above a barrier use nothing beneath them, layers below a barrier use only the operations from the layer above.
